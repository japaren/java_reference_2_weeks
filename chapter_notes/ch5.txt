Chapter V : Control Statements


Keywords: selection statements, iteratio statementsn,  Execption handling features will come later, jump statements

Practical Cmompetences:  Obtain user input with System.in.read() + throws java.IOException, enhanced for

In short...

So this covers basic control over statement such as if-then-else, for, do, do while, continue, break, return and some others. This is the most basic aspect of any programming language therefore it will be used constantly decreasing the need to formulate an actual drill for this

Tha said, exception handling is a feature to deal with the user being too dumb when a input is asked and will be covered later

For now, try to understand how to use the enhanced for and if you don't know the other control statements
