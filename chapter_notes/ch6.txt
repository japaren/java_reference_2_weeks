Chapter VI : Introducing Classes

Keywords: "class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class", instance variables, methods, member of the class, dot operator, allocate memory to object, constructor, encapsulation

Pratical Competences: Initialize an object,  modify an instance variable within an object

In short...
 I'll just quote what was said earlier "class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class". this means that an object is made of: Instance variables, a constructor(to initialize it's parameters) and methods.
 The encapsulation is shown in java through the use of classes since you can only modify it's instance variables with the methods built in the class

 Going a little bit deeper into the initialization of an object... You'd need to follow the syntax:
 Typefile(the class name) varname;
 varname = new Typefile();
The short version is given by Typefile varname = new Typefile()
Depending on the object you may need to include some args that should be made explicit in the constructor
