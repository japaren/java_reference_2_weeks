Chapter III : Data Types, Variables, and Arrays

Keywords: strongly typed language, primitive types of data, unicode, underscore, dynamic initialization, scope, class, methods, type promotion, strkngs are objects

Practical Competences: using the basic types of data, type conversion, arrays with unusual row x col sizes

Skipped topics that could be important: Literals

In short....

Java is a strongly typed language, which is merely a fancy way to say data types have to be declared in order to initialize variables

The primitive data types consist of byte, short, , int, float, double, boolean, char and long. I don't need to dig too deep into this because of the type promotion that Java uses where:
byte, short and char are promoted to int regardless. Everything else is promoted upwards to accomodate the needs.

*Java uses UNICODE
*Dynamic initialization of variables is useful to shorten the code
